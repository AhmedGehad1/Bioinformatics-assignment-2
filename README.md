- **Output**:
  1. **Text File: `tree_details.txt`**
     - Details the tree distances between sequences.
     - Specifies which nodes are grouped together to which parents.
     - Example structure with 5 nodes named as inner1, inner2, ..., inner5.

  2. **Tree Figure: `tree.png`**
     - Reconstructed phylogenetic tree visualized using the Phylo library.
     - Includes distances printed on the tree figure for clarity.
